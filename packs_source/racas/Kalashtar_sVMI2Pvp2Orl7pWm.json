Instead, their minds draw from the memories of their otherworldly spirit while they sleep. As such, you are immune to spells and other magical effects that require you to dream, like @UUID[Compendium.renegados-compendium.magias.Item.dUu2htJQoxRXgxD2], but not to spells and other magical effects that put you to sleep, like @UUID[Compendium.renegados-compendium.magias.Item.xiVu2QFfxIV6ivaY].</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Languages\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Languages.</span> You can speak, read, and write Common, Quori, and one other language of your choice.</p></div></div><hr class=\"hr-1\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><div class=\"rd__quote\"><p class=\"rd__quote-line rd__quote-line--last\">“<em>I am kalashtar, born of two worlds. Over a thousand years ago, my ancestor bound her bloodline to the spirit Kashtai, and I am a child of that union. Kashtai moves within me. Her memories come to me in dreams, and at times her voice whispers in the silence of my mind. As long as at least one of my sisters is alive, Kashtai will survive—and as long as she lives, she will fight il-Lashtavar.</em>”</p><p><span class=\"rd__quote-by\">— Lakashtai, servant of the light</span></p></div><p>The kalashtar are a compound people, created from the union of humanity and renegade spirits from the plane of dreams—spirits called quori. Kalashtar are often seen as wise, spiritual people with great compassion for others. There is an unmistakable alien quality to the kalashtar, though, as they are haunted by the conflicts of their otherworldly spirits.</p><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Bound to Spirits\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Bound to Spirits.</span> Every kalashtar has a connection to a spirit of light, a bond shared by other members of their bloodline. Kalashtar appear human, but their spiritual connection affects them in a variety of ways. Kalashtar have symmetrical, slightly angular features, and their eyes often glow when they are focused or expressing strong emotions.</p><p>Kalashtar can't directly communicate with their quori spirits. Rather, they might experience this relationship as a sense of instinct and inspiration, drawing on the memories of the spirit when they dream. This connection grants kalashtar minor psionic abilities, as well as protection from psychic attacks. All of these quori dream-spirits are virtuous, but some are warriors and others are more contemplative. Work together with the DM to determine the nature of your linked spirit. Typically, a kalashtar knows the name and nature of their spirit, but some may know nothing of their spirit or the source of their psychic gifts, such as an orphan kalashtar raised among strangers.</p><p>The bond to the spirit can cause some kalashtar to display unusual quirks. Consider rolling or selecting a trait from the Kalashtar Quirks table.</p><table class=\"w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Kalashtar Quirks\"><caption>Kalashtar Quirks</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"rd__th ve-col-2 ve-text-center \" data-rd-isroller=\"true\">[[/r d10]]</th><th class=\"rd__th ve-col-10 \" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Quirk</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-2 ve-text-center \" data-roll-min=\"1\" data-roll-max=\"1\">1</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-10 \">You try to understand the motives and feelings of your enemies.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-2 ve-text-center \" data-roll-min=\"2\" data-roll-max=\"2\">2</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-10 \">You prefer using telepathy over speaking aloud.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-2 ve-text-center \" data-roll-min=\"3\" data-roll-max=\"3\">3</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-10 \">You feel a strong drive to protect the innocent.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-2 ve-text-center \" data-roll-min=\"4\" data-roll-max=\"4\">4</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-10 \">You apply dream logic to mundane situations.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-2 ve-text-center \" data-roll-min=\"5\" data-roll-max=\"5\">5</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-10 \">You discuss things out loud with your quori spirit.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-2 ve-text-center \" data-roll-min=\"6\" data-roll-max=\"6\">6</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-10 \">You suppress your emotions and rely on logic.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-2 ve-text-center \" data-roll-min=\"7\" data-roll-max=\"7\">7</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-10 \">You are strongly influenced by the emotions of those around you.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-2 ve-text-center \" data-roll-min=\"8\" data-roll-max=\"8\">8</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-10 \">You prefer to find nonviolent solutions to problems whenever possible.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-2 ve-text-center \" data-roll-min=\"9\" data-roll-max=\"9\">9</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-10 \">You are driven by a warrior spirit and will fight for any noble cause.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-2 ve-text-center \" data-roll-min=\"10\" data-roll-max=\"10\">10</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-10 \">You are obsessed with Dreaming Dark conspiracies.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Hunted by Nightmares\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Hunted by Nightmares.</span> The virtuous spirits tied to the kalashtar fled from the dream-realm of Dal Quor to escape evil spirits that dominate it. The rebel quori believe that through meditation and devotion, they can change the fundamental nature of Dal Quor, shifting the balance from darkness to light. Most kalashtar communities focus on acts of devotion known as the Path of Light. But the dark powers of Dal Quor have their own plans for Eberron. Through the force known as the Dreaming Dark, these monsters manipulate the folk of Khorvaire to eliminate kalashtar whenever possible.</p><p>Many kalashtar defend themselves from the Dreaming Dark by focusing on devotion to the Path of Light. Others, though, seek out the agents of the Dreaming Dark and oppose their plans, or protect the innocent however they can. Still other kalashtar grow up isolated, knowing nothing about Dal Quor or the Dreaming Dark. Such orphans might use their abilities for personal gain or otherwise act against the virtuous instincts of their quori spirits; this can cause internal conflicts and violent mood swings.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Kalashtar Names\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Kalashtar Names.</span> A kalashtar name adds a personal prefix to the name of the quori spirit within the kalashtar. Such names have no relation to the kalashtar's gender.</p><p>Kalashtar orphans are unlikely to know the name of their spirit and take names from another source.</p><p><strong>Quori Names</strong>: Ashana, Ashtai, Ishara, Hareth, Khad, Kosh, Melk, Nari, Tana, Tari, Tash, Ulad, Vakri, Vash</p><p><strong>Kalashtar Names</strong>: Coratash, Dalavash, Dolishara, Halakosh, Khoratari, Koratana, Lanhareth, Molavakri, Nevitash, Sorashana, Torashtai, Valakhad, Vishara</p></div></div></div></div>",
