      "value": "<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p>All barbarians harbor a fury within. Their rage grants them superior strength, durability, and speed. Barbarians who follow the Path of the Storm Herald learn to transform that rage into a mantle of primal magic, which swirls around them. When in a fury, a barbarian of this path taps into the forces of nature to create powerful magical effects.</p><p>Storm heralds are typically elite champions who train alongside druids, rangers, and others sworn to protect nature. Other storm heralds hone their craft in lodges in regions wracked by storms, in the frozen reaches at the world's end, or deep in the hottest deserts.</p><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Storm Aura\" data-source=\"XGE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, p10\">Storm Aura</span></h3> <p>Starting at 3rd level, you emanate a stormy, magical aura while you rage. The aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but not through &amp;Reference[rule=totalcover]{total cover}.</p><p>Your aura has an effect that activates when you enter your rage, and you can activate the effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action. Choose desert, sea, or tundra. Your aura's effect depends on that chosen environment, as detailed below. You can change your environment choice whenever you gain a level in this class.</p><p>If your aura's effects require a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p></p><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Desert\" data-source=\"XGE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"2\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, p10\">Desert.</span></span> When this effect is activated, all other creatures in your aura take 2 fire damage each. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3 at 5th level, 4 at 10th level, 5 at 15th level, and 6 at 20th level.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Sea\" data-source=\"XGE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, p10\">Sea.</span></span> When this effect is activated, you can choose one other creature you can see in your aura. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes [[/damage 1d6 type=lightning]] damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to [[/damage 2d6]] at 10th level, [[/damage 3d6]] at 15th level, and [[/damage 4d6]] at 20th level.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Tundra\" data-source=\"XGE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"4\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, p10\">Tundra.</span></span> When this effect is activated, each creature of your choice in your aura gains 2 temporary hit points, as icy spirits inure it to suffering. The temporary hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3 at 5th level, 4 at 10th level, 5 at 15th level, and 6 at 20th level.</p></div></div></div></div>",
