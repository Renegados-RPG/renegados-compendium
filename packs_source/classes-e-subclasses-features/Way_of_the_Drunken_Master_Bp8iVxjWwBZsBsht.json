      "value": "<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p>The Way of the Drunken Master teaches its students to move with the jerky, unpredictable movements of a drunkard. A drunken master sways, tottering on unsteady feet, to present what seems like an incompetent combatant who proves frustrating to engage. The drunken master's erratic stumbles conceal a carefully executed dance of blocks, parries, advances, attacks, and retreats.</p><p>A drunken master often enjoys playing the fool to bring gladness to the despondent or to demonstrate humility to the arrogant, but when battle is joined, the drunken master can be a maddening, masterful foe.</p><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Bonus Proficiencies\" data-source=\"XGE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, p33\">Bonus Proficiencies</span></h3> <p>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the &amp;Reference[skill=Performance] skill if you don't already have it. Your martial arts technique mixes combat training with the precision of a dancer and the antics of a jester. You also gain proficiency with @item[brewer's supplies|phb] if you don't already have it.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Drunken Technique\" data-source=\"XGE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"2\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, p33\">Drunken Technique</span></h3> <p>At 3rd level, you learn how to twist and turn quickly as part of your Flurry of Blows. Whenever you use Flurry of Blows, you gain the benefit of the @action[Disengage] action, and your walking speed increases by 10 feet until the end of the current turn.</p></div></div>",
