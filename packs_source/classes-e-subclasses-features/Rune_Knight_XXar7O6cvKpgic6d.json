      "value": "<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p>Rune Knights enhance their martial prowess using the supernatural power of runes, an ancient practice that originated with giants. Rune cutters can be found among any family of giants, and you likely learned your methods first or second hand from such a mystical artisan. Whether you found the giant's work carved into a hill or cave, learned of the runes from a sage, or met the giant in person, you studied the giant's craft and learned how to apply magic runes to empower your equipment.</p><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Bonus Proficiencies\" data-source=\"TCE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything, p44\">Bonus Proficiencies</span></h3> <p><i>3rd-level Rune Knight feature</i></p><p>You gain proficiency with @item[smith's tools|PHB], and you learn to speak, read, and write @language[Giant].</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Rune Carver\" data-source=\"TCE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"2\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything, p44\">Rune Carver</span></h3> <p><i>3rd-level Rune Knight feature</i></p><p>You can use magic runes to enhance your gear. You learn two runes of your choice, from among the runes described below, and each time you gain a level in this class, you can replace one rune you know with a different one from this feature. When you reach certain levels in this class, you learn additional runes, as shown in the Runes Known table.</p><p>Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a number of objects equal to the number of runes you know, and you inscribe a different rune onto each of the objects. To be eligible, an object must be a weapon, a suit of armor, a shield, a piece of jewelry, or something else you can wear or hold in a hand. Your rune remains on an object until you finish a long rest, and an object can bear only one of your runes at a time.</p><table class=\"w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Runes Known\"><caption>Runes Known</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"rd__th ve-col-6 ve-text-center \" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Fighter Level</th><th class=\"rd__th ve-col-6 ve-text-center \" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Number of Runes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-6 ve-text-center \">3rd</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-6 ve-text-center \">2</td></tr><tr><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-6 ve-text-center \">7th</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-6 ve-text-center \">3</td></tr><tr><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-6 ve-text-center \">10th</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-6 ve-text-center \">4</td></tr><tr><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-6 ve-text-center \">15th</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-6 ve-text-center \">5</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The following runes are available to you when you learn a rune. If a rune has a level requirement, you must be at least that level in this class to learn the rune. If a rune requires a saving throw, your Rune Magic save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p></p><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Cloud Rune\" data-source=\"TCE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything, p44\">Cloud Rune.</span></span> This rune emulates the deceptive magic used by some cloud giants. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Dexterity (&amp;Reference[skill=SleightofHand]{Sleight of Hand}) checks and Charisma (&amp;Reference[skill=Deception]) checks.</p><p>In addition, when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to invoke the rune and choose a different creature within 30 feet of you, other than the attacker. The chosen creature becomes the target of the attack, using the same roll. This magic can transfer the attack's effects regardless of the attack's range. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Fire Rune\" data-source=\"TCE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"4\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything, p44\">Fire Rune.</span></span> This rune's magic channels the masterful craftsmanship of great smiths. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool.</p><p>In addition, when you hit a creature with an attack using a weapon, you can invoke the rune to summon fiery shackles: the target takes an extra [[/damage 2d6 type=fire]] damage, and it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be &amp;Reference[condition=restrained] for 1 minute. While &amp;Reference[condition=restrained] by the shackles, the target takes [[/damage 2d6 type=fire]] damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, banishing the shackles on a success. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Frost Rune\" data-source=\"TCE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"5\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything, p45\">Frost Rune.</span></span> This rune's magic evokes the might of those who survive in the wintry wilderness, such as frost giants. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Wisdom (&amp;Reference[skill=AnimalHandling]{Animal Handling}) checks and Charisma (&amp;Reference[skill=Intimidation]) checks.</p><p>In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action to increase your sturdiness. For 10 minutes, you gain a +2 bonus to all ability checks and saving throws that use Strength or Constitution. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Hill Rune (7th Level or Higher)\" data-source=\"TCE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"6\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything, p45\">Hill Rune (7th Level or Higher).</span></span> This rune's magic bestows a resilience reminiscent of a hill giant.

Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Stone Rune\" data-source=\"TCE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"7\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything, p45\">Stone Rune.</span></span> This rune's magic channels the judiciousness associated with stone giants. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Wisdom (&amp;Reference[skill=Insight]) checks, and you have &amp;Reference[rule=darkvision] out to a range of 120 feet.</p><p>In addition, when a creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to invoke the rune and force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the creature is &amp;Reference[condition=charmed] by you for 1 minute. While &amp;Reference[condition=charmed] in this way, the creature has a speed of 0 and is &amp;Reference[condition=incapacitated], descending into a dreamy stupor. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Storm Rune (7th Level or Higher)\" data-source=\"TCE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"8\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything, p45\">Storm Rune (7th Level or Higher).</span></span> Using this rune, you can glimpse the future like a storm giant seer.

Until the state ends, when you or another creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to cause the roll to have advantage or disadvantage. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p></div></div></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Giant's Might\" data-source=\"TCE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"9\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything, p44\">Giant's Might</span></h3> <p><i>3rd-level Rune Knight feature</i></p><p>You have learned how to imbue yourself with the might of giants.
