This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells. See <a href=\"https://2014.5e.tools/book.html#PHB,10\">chapter 10</a> for the general rules of spellcasting and <a href=\"https://2014.5e.tools/book.html#PHB,11\">chapter 11</a> for the <a href=\"https://2014.5e.tools/spells.html#blankhash,flstclass:sorcerer=1\">sorcerer spell list</a>.</p><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Cantrips\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Cantrips.</span></span> At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn an additional sorcerer cantrip of your choice at 4th level and another at 10th level.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Spell Slots\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"2\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Spell Slots.</span></span> The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your <a href=\"https://2014.5e.tools/spells.html#blankhash,flstclass:sorcerer=1\">sorcerer spells</a> of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell @spell[burning hands] and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast @spell[burning hands] using either slot.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher.</span></span> You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.</p><p>You learn an additional sorcerer spell of your choice at each level except 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, 19th, and 20th. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p><p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Spellcasting Ability\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"4\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Spellcasting Ability.</span></span> Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><div class=\"rd__wrp-centered-ability\"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + Charisma modifier + Proficiency Bonus</div><div class=\"rd__wrp-centered-ability\"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = Charisma modifier + Proficiency Bonus</div></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Spellcasting Focus\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"5\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Spellcasting Focus.</span></span> You can use an @item[arcane focus|phb] as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.</p></div></div>",
