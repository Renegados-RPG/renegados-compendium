      "value": "<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p><i>2nd-level artificer feature</i></p><p>You've gained the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions, turning those objects into magic items.</p><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Infusions Known\" data-source=\"TCE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Tashaâ€™s Cauldron of Everything, p9\">Infusions Known</span></h3> <p>When you gain this feature, pick four artificer infusions to learn, choosing from the \"<a href=\"https://2014.5e.tools/optionalfeatures.html#blankhash,flstfeature%20type:ai=1,flstsource:tce=1\">Artificer Infusions</a>\" section at the end of the class's description. You learn additional infusions of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Infusions Known column of the Artificer table.</p><p>Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer infusions you learned with a new one.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Artificer Infusions\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"2\"><h4 class=\"entry-title-inner\">Artificer Infusions</h4><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"></span></span><p>Artificers have invented numerous magical infusions, extraordinary processes that rapidly create magic items. To many, artificers seem like wonderworkers, accomplishing in hours what others need weeks to complete.</p><p>The description of each of the following infusions details the type of item that can receive it, along with whether the resulting magic item requires attunement.</p><p>Some infusions specify a minimum artificer level. You can't learn such an infusion until you are at least that level.</p><p>Unless an infusion's description says otherwise, you can't learn an infusion more than once.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Infusing an Item\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"3\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Infusing an Item</span></h3> <p>Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion's description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see \"<a href=\"https://2014.5e.tools/book.html#DMG,7,attunement,0\">Attunement</a>\" in chapter 7 of the <a href=\"https://2014.5e.tools/book.html#DMG\">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>).</p><p>Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you give up your knowledge of the infusion for another one.</p><p>You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the Artificer table. You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion immediately ends, and then the new infusion applies.</p><p>If an infusion ends on an item that contains other things, like a @item[bag of holding], its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.</p></div></div>",
