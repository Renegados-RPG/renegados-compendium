It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.</p><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Domain Spells\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Domain Spells.</span></span> Each domain has a list of spells—its domain spells—that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p><p>If you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.</p></div></div>",
