A discipline requires you to spend ki points each time you use it.</p><p>You know the Elemental Attunement discipline and one other elemental discipline of your choice. You learn one additional elemental discipline of your choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.</p><p>Whenever you learn a new elemental discipline, you can also replace one elemental discipline that you already know with a different discipline.</p><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Casting Elemental Spells\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Casting Elemental Spells</span></h3> <p>Some elemental disciplines allow you to cast spells. See <a href=\"https://2014.5e.tools/book.html#PHB,10\">chapter 10</a> of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting. To cast one of these spells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you don't need to provide material components for it.</p><p>Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional ki points to increase the level of an elemental discipline spell that you cast, provided that the spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level, as @UUID[Compendium.renegados-compendium.magias.Item.WGdHm2U73KdKbVJ2] does. The spell's level increases by 1 for each additional ki point you spend. For example, if you are a 5th-level monk and use Sweeping Cinder Strike to cast @UUID[Compendium.renegados-compendium.magias.Item.WGdHm2U73KdKbVJ2], you can spend 3 ki points to cast it as a 2nd-level spell (the discipline's base cost of 2 ki points plus 1).</p><p>The maximum number of ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost and any additional ki points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your monk level, as shown in the Spells and Ki Points table. At 5th level, you may spend up to 3 ki points; this increases to 4 ki points at 9th level, 5 at 13th level, and 6 at 17th level.</p><table class=\"w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Spells and Ki Points\"><caption>Spells and Ki Points</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"rd__th ve-col-5 ve-text-center \" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Monk Levels</th><th class=\"rd__th ve-col-7 ve-text-center \" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Maximum Ki Points for a Spell</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-5 ve-text-center \">5th-8th</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-7 ve-text-center \">3</td></tr><tr><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-5 ve-text-center \">9th-12th</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-7 ve-text-center \">4</td></tr><tr><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-5 ve-text-center \">13th-16th</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-7 ve-text-center \">5</td></tr><tr><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-5 ve-text-center \">17th-20th</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-7 ve-text-center \">6</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>",
