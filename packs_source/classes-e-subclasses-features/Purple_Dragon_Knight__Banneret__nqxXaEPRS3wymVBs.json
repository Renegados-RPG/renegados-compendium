      "value": "<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p>Purple Dragon Knights are warriors who hail from the kingdom of Cormyr. Pledged to protect the crown, they take the fight against evil beyond the kingdom's borders. They are tasked with wandering the land as knights errant, relying on their judgment, bravery, and fidelity to guide them in defeating evildoers.</p><p>A Purple Dragon Knight inspires greatness in others by committing brave deeds in battle. The mere presence of a knight in a hamlet is enough to cause some orcs and bandits to seek easier prey. A lone knight is a skilled warrior, but a knight leading a band of allies can transform even the most poorly equipped militia into a ferocious war band.</p><p>A knight prefers to lead through deeds, not words. As a knight spearheads an attack, the knight's actions can awaken reserves of courage and conviction in allies that they never suspected they had.</p><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Restriction: Knighthood\" data-source=\"SCAG\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide, p128\">Restriction: Knighthood</span></h3> <p>Purple Dragon Knights are tied to a specific order of Cormyrean knighthood.</p><p>Banneret serves as the generic name for this archetype if you use it in other campaign settings or to model warlords other than the Purple Dragon Knights.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Rallying Cry\" data-source=\"SCAG\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"2\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide, p128\">Rallying Cry</span></h3> <p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn how to inspire your allies to fight on past their injuries.</p><p>When you use your Second Wind feature, you can choose up to three creatures within 60 feet of you that are allied with you.
