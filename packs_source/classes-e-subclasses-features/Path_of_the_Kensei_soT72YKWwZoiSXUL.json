This path also includes instruction in the deft strokes of calligraphy or painting. You gain the following benefits.</p><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Kensei Weapons\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Kensei Weapons</span></h3> <p>Choose two types of weapons to be your kensei weapons: one melee weapon and one ranged weapon. Each of these weapons can be any <a href=\"https://2014.5e.tools/items.html#blankhash,flstsource:phb=1,flstcategory:basic=1,flsttype:martial%20weapon=1~simple%20weapon=1\">simple or martial weapon</a> that lacks the heavy and special properties. The longbow is also a valid choice. You gain proficiency with these weapons if you don't already have it. Weapons of the chosen types are monk weapons for you. Many of this tradition's features work only with your kensei weapons. When you reach 6th, 11th, and 17th level in this class, you can choose another type of weapon—either melee or ranged—to be a kensei weapon for you, following the criteria above.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Agile Parry\" data-source=\"XGE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"2\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, p34\">Agile Parry</span></h3> <p>If you make an unarmed strike as part of the @action[Attack] action on your turn and are holding a kensei weapon, you can use it to defend yourself if it is a melee weapon.

When you do so, any target you hit with a ranged attack using a kensei weapon takes an extra [[/damage 1d4]] damage of the weapon's type. You retain this benefit until the end of the current turn.</p></div></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Way of the Brush\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"4\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Way of the Brush</span></h3> <p>You gain proficiency with your choice of @item[calligrapher's supplies|phb] or @item[painter's supplies|phb].</p></div></div>",
