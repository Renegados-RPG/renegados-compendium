      "value": "<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p>The archetypal Cavalier excels at mounted combat. Usually born among the nobility and raised at court, a Cavalier is equally at home leading a cavalry charge or exchanging repartee at a state dinner. Cavaliers also learn how to guard those in their charge from harm, often serving as the protectors of their superiors and of the weak. Compelled to right wrongs or earn prestige, many of these fighters leave their lives of comfort to embark on glorious adventure.</p><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Bonus Proficiency\" data-source=\"XGE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, p30\">Bonus Proficiency</span></h3> <p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: &amp;Reference[skill=AnimalHandling]{Animal Handling}, &amp;Reference[skill=History], &amp;Reference[skill=Insight], &amp;Reference[skill=Performance], or &amp;Reference[skill=Persuasion]. Alternatively, you learn one language of your choice.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Born to the Saddle\" data-source=\"XGE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"2\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, p30\">Born to the Saddle</span></h3> <p>Starting at 3rd level, your mastery as a rider becomes apparent. You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off your mount. If you fall off your mount and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on your feet if you're not &amp;Reference[condition=incapacitated].</p><p>Finally, mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Unwavering Mark\" data-source=\"XGE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"3\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, p30\">Unwavering Mark</span></h3> <p>Starting at 3rd level, you can menace your foes, foiling their attacks and punishing them for harming others. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can mark the creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends early if you are &amp;Reference[condition=incapacitated] or you die, or if someone else marks the creature.</p><p>While it is within 5 feet of you, a creature marked by you has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn't target you.</p><p>In addition, if a creature marked by you deals damage to anyone other than you, you can make a special melee weapon attack against the marked creature as a bonus action on your next turn. You have advantage on the attack roll, and if it hits, the attack's weapon deals extra damage to the target equal to half your fighter level.</p><p>Regardless of the number of creatures you mark, you can make this special attack a number of times equal to your Strength modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</p></div></div>",
