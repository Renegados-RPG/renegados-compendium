      "value": "<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p>Most folk are happy to welcome a bard into their midst. Bards of the College of Whispers use this to their advantage. They appear to be like other bards, sharing news, singing songs, and telling tales to the audiences they gather. In truth, the College of Whispers teaches its students that they are wolves among sheep. These bards use their knowledge and magic to uncover secrets and turn them against others through extortion and threats.</p><p>Many other bards hate the College of Whispers, viewing it as a parasite that uses a bard's reputation to acquire wealth and power. For this reason, members of this college rarely reveal their true nature. They typically claim to follow some other college, or they keep their actual calling secret in order to infiltrate and exploit royal courts and other settings of power.</p><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Psychic Blades\" data-source=\"XGE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, p16\">Psychic Blades</span></h3> <p>When you join the College of Whispers at 3rd level, you gain the ability to make your weapon attacks magically toxic to a creature's mind.</p><p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to deal an extra [[/damage 2d6 type=psychic]] damage to that target. You can do so only once per round on your turn.</p><p>The psychic damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to [[/damage 3d6]] at 5th level, [[/damage 5d6]] at 10th level, and [[/damage 8d6]] at 15th level.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Words of Terror\" data-source=\"XGE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"2\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, p16\">Words of Terror</span></h3> <p>At 3rd level, you learn to infuse innocent-seeming words with an insidious magic that can inspire terror.</p><p>If you speak to a humanoid alone for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to seed paranoia in its mind. At the end of the conversation, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be &amp;Reference[condition=frightened] of you or another creature of your choice. The target is &amp;Reference[condition=frightened] in this way for 1 hour, until it is attacked or damaged, or until it witnesses its allies being attacked or damaged.</p><p>If the target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that you tried to frighten it.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p></div></div>",
