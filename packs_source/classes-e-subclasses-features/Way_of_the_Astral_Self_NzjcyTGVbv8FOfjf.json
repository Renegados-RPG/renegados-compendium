      "value": "<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p>A monk who follows the Way of the Astral Self believes their body is an illusion. They see their ki as a representation of their true form, an astral self. This astral self has the capacity to be a force of order or disorder, with some monasteries training students to use their power to protect the weak and other instructing aspirants in how to manifest their true selves in service to the mighty.</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Forms of Your Astral Self\" data-source=\"TCE\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"1\"><h4 class=\"entry-title-inner\">Forms of Your Astral Self</h4><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"> <span class=\"rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset\"><span class=\"help-subtle\" title=\"Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything\">TCE</span> <span title=\"Page 50\">p50</span></span></span></span><p>The astral self is a translucent embodiment of the monk's soul. As a result, an astral self can reflect aspects of a monk's background, ideals, flaws, and bonds, and an astral self doesn't necessarily look anything like the monk. For example, the astral self of a lanky human might be reminiscent of a minotaur-the strength of which the monk feels within. Similarly, an orc monk might manifest gossamer arms and a delicate visage, representing the gentle beauty of the orc's soul. Each astral self is unique, and some of the monks of this monastic tradition are known more for the appearance of their astral self than for their physical appearance.</p><p>When choosing this path, consider the quirks that define your monk. Are you obsessed with something? Are you driven by justice or a selfish desire? Any of these motivations could manifest in the form of your astral self.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Arms of the Astral Self\" data-source=\"TCE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"2\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything, p50\">Arms of the Astral Self</span></h3> <p><i>3rd-level Way of the Astral Self feature</i></p><p>Your mastery of your ki allows you to summon a portion of your astral self. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 ki point to summon the arms of your astral self. When you do so, each creature of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take force damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die.</p><p>For 10 minutes, these spectral arms hover near your shoulders or surround your arms (your choice). You determine the arms' appearance, and they vanish early if you are &amp;Reference[condition=incapacitated] or die.</p><p>While the spectral arms are present, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">You can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Strength modifier when making Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">You can use the spectral arms to make unarmed strikes.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">When you make an unarmed strike with the arms on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater than normal.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">The unarmed strikes you make with the arms can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls, and their damage type is force.</li></ul></div></div>",
