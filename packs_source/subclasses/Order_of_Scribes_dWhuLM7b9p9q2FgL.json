The name is apt, given how much time wizards spend poring over tomes and penning theories about the nature of magic. It's rare to see wizards traveling without books and scrolls sprouting from their bags, and a wizard would go to great lengths to plumb an archive of ancient knowledge.</p><p>Among wizards, the Order of Scribes is the most bookish. It takes many forms in different worlds, but its primary mission is the same everywhere: recording magical discoveries so that wizardry can flourish. And while all wizards value spellbooks, a wizard in the Order of Scribes magically awakens their book, turning it into a trusted companion. All wizards study books, but a wizardly scribe talks to theirs!</p><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Level 2: Wizardly Quill\" data-source=\"TCE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"4\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything, p77\">Level 2: Wizardly Quill</span></h3><p><em>2nd-level Order of Scribes feature</em></p><p>As a bonus action, you can magically create a Tiny quill in your free hand. The magic quill has the following properties:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">The quill doesn't require ink. When you write with it, it produces ink in a color of your choice on the writing surface.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">The time you must spend to copy a spell into your spellbook equals 2 minutes per spell level if you use the quill for the transcription.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">You can erase anything you write with the quill if you wave the feather over the text as a bonus action, provided the text is within 5 feet of you.</li></ul><p>This quill disappears if you create another one or if you die.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Level 2: Awakened Spellbook\" data-source=\"TCE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"5\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything, p77\">Level 2: Awakened Spellbook</span></h3><p><em>2nd-level Order of Scribes feature</em></p><p>Using specially prepared inks and ancient incantations passed down by your wizardly order, you have awakened an arcane sentience within your spellbook.</p><p>While you are holding the book, it grants you the following benefits:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">You can use the book as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">When you cast a wizard spell with a spell slot, you can temporarily replace its damage type with a type that appears in another spell in your spellbook, which magically alters the spell's formula for this casting only. The latter spell must be of the same level as the spell slot you expend.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">When you cast a wizard spell as a ritual, you can use the spell's normal casting time, rather than adding 10 minutes to it. Once you use this benefit, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.</li></ul><p>If necessary, you can replace the book over the course of a short rest by using your Wizardly Quill to write arcane sigils in a blank book or a magic spellbook to which you're attuned. At the end of the rest, your spellbook's consciousness is summoned into the new book, which the consciousness transforms into your spellbook, along with all its spells. If the previous book still existed somewhere, all the spells vanish from its pages.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Level 6: Manifest Mind\" data-source=\"TCE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"6\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything, p78\">Level 6: Manifest Mind</span></h3><p><em>6th-level Order of Scribes feature</em></p><p>You can conjure forth the mind of your Awakened Spellbook. As a bonus action while the book is on your person, you can cause the mind to manifest as a Tiny spectral object, hovering in an unoccupied space of your choice within 60 feet of you. The spectral mind is intangible and doesn't occupy its space, and it sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. It looks like a ghostly tome, a cascade of text, or a scholar from the past (your choice).</p><p>While manifested, the spectral mind can hear and see, and it has &amp;Reference[rule=darkvision] with a range of 60 feet. The mind can telepathically share with you what it sees and hears (no action required).</p><p>Whenever you cast a wizard spell on your turn, you can cast it as if you were in the spectral mind's space, instead of your own, using its senses. You can do so a number of times per day equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><p>As a bonus action, you can cause the spectral mind to hover up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you or it can see. It can pass through creatures but not objects.</p><p>The spectral mind stops manifesting if it is ever more than 300 feet away from you, if someone casts @UUID[Compendium.renegados-compendium.magias.Item.ZZeFyNktRmVEqrar] on it, if the Awakened Spellbook is destroyed, if you die, or if you dismiss the spectral mind as a bonus action.</p><p>Once you conjure the mind, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of any level to conjure it again.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Level 10: Master Scrivener\" data-source=\"TCE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything, p78\">Level 10: Master Scrivener</span></h3><p><em>10th-level Order of Scribes feature</em></p><p>Whenever you finish a long rest, you can create one magic scroll by touching your Wizardly Quill to a blank piece of paper or parchment and causing one spell from your Awakened Spellbook to be copied onto the scroll. The spellbook must be within 5 feet of you when you make the scroll.</p><p>The chosen spell must be of 1st or 2nd level and must have a casting time of 1 action. Once in the scroll, the spell's power is enhanced, counting as one level higher than normal. You can cast the spell from the scroll by reading it as an action. The scroll is unintelligible to anyone else, and the spell vanishes from the scroll when you cast it or when you finish your next long rest.</p><p>You are also adept at crafting spell scrolls, which are described in the treasure chapter of the Dungeon Master's Guide. The gold and time you must spend to make such a scroll are halved if you use your Wizardly Quill.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Level 14: One with the Word\" data-source=\"TCE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"8\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything, p78\">Level 14: One with the Word</span></h3><p><em>14th-level Order of Scribes feature</em></p><p>Your connection to your Awakened Spellbook has become so profound that your soul has become entwined with it. While the book is on your person, you have advantage on all Intelligence (&amp;Reference[skill=Arcana]) checks, as the spellbook helps you remember magical lore.</p><p>Moreover, if you take damage while your spellbook's mind is manifested, you can prevent all of that damage to you by using your reaction to dismiss the spectral mind, using its magic to save yourself. Then roll [[/r 3d6]]. The spellbook temporarily loses spells of your choice that have a combined spell level equal to that roll or higher. For example, if the roll's total is 9, spells vanish from the book that have a combined level of at least 9, which could mean one 9th-level spell, three 3rd-level spells, or some other combination. If there aren't enough spells in the book to cover this cost, you drop to 0 hit points.</p><p>Until you finish [[/r 1d6]] long rests, you are incapable of casting the lost spells, even if you find them on a scroll or in another spellbook. After you finish the required number of rests, the spells reappear in the spellbook.</p><p>Once you use this reaction, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.</p></div></div></div></div>",
