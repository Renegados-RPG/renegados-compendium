Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar to those practiced by wizards. They focus their study on two of the eight schools of magic—abjuration and evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter's reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively small number of spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in a spellbook.</p><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Spellcasting\" data-source=\"PHB\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Spellcasting</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"> </span><span class=\"help-subtle\" title=\"Player’s Handbook (2014)\">PHB'14</span> <span title=\"Page 74\">p74</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable no-select no-print lst-is-exporting-image__hidden\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\" title=\"Toggle Visibility (CTRL to Toggle All)\">[–]</span></h3><p>When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells.
