If you are raging and another creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to reduce that damage by [[/r 2d6]].</p><p>When you reach certain levels in this class, you can reduce the damage by more: by [[/r 3d6]] at 10th level and by [[/r 4d6]] at 14th level.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Level 10: Consult the Spirits\" data-source=\"XGE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"5\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, p9\">Level 10: Consult the Spirits</span></h3><p>At 10th level, you gain the ability to consult with your ancestral spirits.

Rather than creating a spherical sensor, this use of @UUID[Compendium.renegados-compendium.magias.Item.rlWCBGq8NkfpBJCZ] invisibly summons one of your ancestral spirits to the chosen location. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p><p>After you cast either spell in this way, you can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Level 14: Vengeful Ancestors\" data-source=\"XGE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"6\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, p9\">Level 14: Vengeful Ancestors</span></h3><p>At 14th level, your ancestral spirits grow powerful enough to retaliate.
