If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different wizard cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn't count against your number of cantrips known.</p><p>When you cast @UUID[Compendium.renegados-compendium.magias.Item.H0rSowwQhSqNK8bm], you can create both a sound and an image with a single casting of the spell.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Level 6: Malleable Illusions\" data-source=\"PHB\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"6\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Player’s Handbook (2014), p118\">Level 6: Malleable Illusions</span></h3> <p>Starting at 6th level, when you cast an illusion spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can use your action to change the nature of that illusion (using the spell's normal parameters for the illusion), provided that you can see the illusion.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Level 10: Illusory Self\" data-source=\"PHB\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Player’s Handbook (2014), p118\">Level 10: Illusory Self</span></h3> <p>Beginning at 10th level, you can create an illusory duplicate of yourself as an instant, almost instinctual reaction to danger. When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to interpose the illusory duplicate between the attacker and yourself. The attack automatically misses you, then the illusion dissipates.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Level 14: Illusory Reality\" data-source=\"PHB\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"8\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Player’s Handbook (2014), p118\">Level 14: Illusory Reality</span></h3> <p>By 14th level, you have learned the secret of weaving shadow magic into your illusions to give them a semireality. When you cast an illusion spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose one inanimate, nonmagical object that is part of the illusion and make that object real. You can do this on your turn as a bonus action while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for 1 minute. For example, you can create an illusion of a bridge over a chasm and then make it real long enough for your allies to cross.</p><p>The object can't deal damage or otherwise directly harm anyone.</p></div></div></div></div>",
