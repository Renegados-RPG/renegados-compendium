These druids recognize that all living things play a role in the natural world, yet they focus on protecting animals and fey creatures that have difficulty defending themselves. Shepherds, as they are known, see such creatures as their charges. They ward off monsters that threaten them, rebuke hunters who kill more prey than necessary, and prevent civilization from encroaching on rare animal habitats and on sites sacred to the fey. Many of these druids are happiest far from cities and towns, content to spend their days in the company of animals and the fey creatures of the wilds.</p><p>Members of this circle become adventurers to oppose forces that threaten their charges or to seek knowledge and power that will help them safeguard their charges better. Wherever these druids go, the spirits of the wilderness are with them.</p><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Speech of the Woods\" data-source=\"XGE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Speech of the Woods</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"> </span><span class=\"help-subtle\" title=\"Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\">XGE</span> <span title=\"Page 23\">p23</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable no-select no-print lst-is-exporting-image__hidden\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\" title=\"Toggle Visibility (CTRL to Toggle All)\">[–]</span></h3><p>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to converse with beasts and many fey.</p><p>You learn to speak, read, and write <a href=\"https://2014.5e.tools/languages.html#sylvan_phb\" data-vet-page=\"languages.html\" data-vet-source=\"PHB\" data-vet-hash=\"sylvan_phb\" data-vet-is-allow-redirect=\"true\">Sylvan</a>.
