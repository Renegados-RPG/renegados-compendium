Tutored by satyrs, eladrin, and other fey, these bards learn to use their magic to delight and captivate others.</p><p>The bards of this college are regarded with a mixture of awe and fear. Their performances are the stuff of legend. These bards are so eloquent that a speech or song that one of them performs can cause captors to release the bard unharmed and can lull a furious dragon into complacency. The same magic that allows them to quell beasts can also bend minds. Villainous bards of this college can leech off a community for weeks, misusing their magic to turn their hosts into thralls. Heroic bards of this college instead use this power to gladden the downtrodden and undermine oppressors.</p><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Mantle of Inspiration\" data-source=\"XGE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Mantle of Inspiration</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"> </span><span class=\"help-subtle\" title=\"Xanathar’s Guide to Everything\">XGE</span> <span title=\"Page 14\">p14</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable no-select no-print lst-is-exporting-image__hidden\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\" title=\"Toggle Visibility (CTRL to Toggle All)\">[–]</span></h3><p>When you join the College of Glamour at 3rd level, you gain the ability to weave a song of fey magic that imbues your allies with vigor and speed.</p><p>As a bonus action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to grant yourself a wondrous appearance.
