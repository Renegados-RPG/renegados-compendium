You retain this shadow until you use it or you finish a long rest.</p><p>You can use the shadow as an action. When you do so, it vanishes, magically transforming into a disguise that appears on you. You now look like the dead person, but healthy and alive. This disguise lasts for 1 hour or until you end it as a bonus action.</p><p>While you're in the disguise, you gain access to all information that the humanoid would freely share with a casual acquaintance. Such information includes general details on its background and personal life, but doesn't include secrets. The information is enough that you can pass yourself off as the person by drawing on its memories.</p><p>Another creature can see through this disguise by succeeding on a Wisdom (&amp;Reference[skill=Insight]) check contested by your Charisma (&amp;Reference[skill=Deception]) check.

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. It automatically succeeds if it doesn't share a language with you or if it can't hear you. On a successful saving throw, your whisper sounds like unintelligible mumbling and has no effect.</p><p>On a failed saving throw, the target is &amp;Reference[condition=charmed] by you for the next 8 hours or until you or your allies attack it, damage it, or force it to make a saving throw. It interprets the whispers as a description of its most mortifying secret. You gain no knowledge of this secret, but the target is convinced you know it.</p><p>The &amp;Reference[condition=charmed] creature obeys your commands for fear that you will reveal its secret. It won't risk its life for you or fight for you, unless it was already inclined to do so. It grants you favors and gifts it would offer to a close friend.</p><p>When the effect ends, the creature has no understanding of why it held you in such fear.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p></div></div></div></div>",
