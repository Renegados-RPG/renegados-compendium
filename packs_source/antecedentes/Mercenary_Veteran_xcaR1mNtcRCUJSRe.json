Now, you look forward to fighting foes and reaping even greater rewards as an adventurer. Your experience makes you familiar with the ins and outs of mercenary life, and you likely have harrowing stories of events on the battlefield. You might have served with a large outfit such as the Zhentarim or the soldiers of Mintarn, or a smaller band of sell-swords, maybe even more than one. (See the \"Mercenaries of the North\" sidebar for a collection of possibilities.)</p><p>Now you're looking for something else, perhaps greater reward for the risks you take, or the freedom to choose your own activities. For whatever reason, you're leaving behind the life of a soldier for hire, but your skills are undeniably suited for battle, so now you fight on in a different way.</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Mercenaries of the North\"><h4 class=\"entry-title-inner\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"1\">Mercenaries of the North</span></h4><p>Countless mercenary companies operate up and down the Sword Coast and throughout the North. Most are smallscale operations that employ a dozen to a hundred folk who offer security services, hunt monsters and brigands, or go to war in exchange for gold. Some organizations, such as the Zhentarim, Flaming Fist, and the nation of Mintarn have hundreds or thousands of members and can provide private armies to those with enough funds. A few organizations operating in the North are described below.</p><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"The Chill\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Chill.</span> The cold and mysterious Lurkwood serves as the home of numerous groups of goblinoids that have banded together into one tribe called the Chill. Unlike most of their kind, the Chill refrains from raiding the people of the North and maintains relatively good relations so that they can hire themselves out as warriors. Few citystates in the North are willing to field an army alongside the Chill, but several are happy to quietly pay the Chill to battle the Uthgardt, orcs, trolls of the Evermoors, and other threats to civilization.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Silent Rain\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Silent Rain.</span> Consisting solely of elves, Silent Rain is a legendary mercenary company operating out of Evereska. Caring little for gold or fame, Silent Rain agrees only to jobs that either promote elven causes or involve destroying orcs, gnolls, and the like. Prospective employers must leave written word (in Elvish) near Evereska, and the Silent Rain sends a representative if interested.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"The Bloodaxes\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Bloodaxes.</span> Founded in Sundabar nearly two centuries ago, the Bloodaxes were originally a group of dwarves outcast from their clans for crimes against the teachings of Moradin Soulforger. They began hiring out as mercenaries to whoever in the North would pay them. Since then the mercenary company has broadened its membership to other races, but every member is an exile, criminal, or misfit of some sort looking for a fresh start and a new family among the bold Bloodaxes.</p></div></div></div></div></div><hr /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\"><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Skill Proficiencies:\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Skill Proficiencies:</span> &amp;Reference[skill=Athletics], &amp;Reference[skill=Persuasion]</p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Tool Proficiencies:\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Tool Proficiencies:</span> One type of <a href=\"https://2014.5e.tools/items.html#blankhash,flstsource:phb=1,flstmiscellaneous:mundane=1,flsttype:gaming%20set=1\">gaming set</a>, <a href=\"https://2014.5e.tools/items.html#blankhash,flstsource:phb=1~dmg=1,flstmiscellaneous:mundane=1,flsttype:vehicle%20(land)=1\">vehicles (land)</a></p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Equipment:\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Equipment:</span> A uniform of your company (@item[traveler's clothes|phb] in quality), an insignia of your rank, a <a href=\"https://2014.5e.tools/items.html#blankhash,flstsource:phb=1,flstmiscellaneous:mundane=1,flsttype:gaming%20set=1\">gaming set</a> of your choice, and a @item[pouch|phb] containing the remainder of your last wages (10 gp).</p></li></ul><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Feature: Mercenary Life\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"5\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Feature: Mercenary Life</span></h3><p>You know the mercenary life as only someone who has experienced it can. You are able to identify mercenary companies by their emblems, and you know a little about any such company, including who has hired them recently. You can find the taverns and festhalls where mercenaries abide in any area, as long as you speak the language. You can find mercenary work between adventures sufficient to maintain a comfortable lifestyle (see \"<a href=\"https://2014.5e.tools/book.html#PHB,8,practicing%20a%20profession,0\">Practicing a Profession</a>\" under \"Downtime Activities\" in chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook).</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Suggested Characteristics\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"6\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Suggested Characteristics</span></h3><p>Use the tables for the @background[soldier] background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a mercenary.</p><p>Your bond could be associated with the company you traveled with previously, or with some of the comrades you served with.
