Yet many generations of study gave rise to various styles of Bladesinging based on the melee weapon employed. The techniques of these styles are passed from master to students in small schools, some of which have a building dedicated to instruction. Even the newest styles are hundreds of years old, but are still taught by their original creators due to the long lives of elves. Most schools of Bladesinging are in Evermeet or Evereska. One was started in Myth Drannor, but the city's destruction has scattered those students who survived.</p><p>Styles of Bladesinging are broadly categorized based on the type of weapon employed, and each is associated with a category of animal. Within that style are specializations named after specific animal types, based on the types of spells employed, the techniques of the master, and the particular weapon used. Bladesingers who apprentice to a master typically get a tattoo of their chosen style's animal. Some bladesingers learn multiple styles and bear many tattoos, wearing a warning on their skin of their deadly skills.</p><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Cat\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Cat.</span> Styles that employ a sword belong to this family. The lion style, the eldest, trains practitioners in the use of the longsword and doesn't favor any particular type of spells. Leopard style focuses on the shortsword and spells of illusion and stealth. Red tiger, a style just three centuries old, has its bladesingers using the scimitar in a whirling dance of defense from which they launch into sudden leaps and attacks.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Bird\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Bird.</span> Styles that focus on the use of a hafted weapon, such as an axe or hammer, have been grouped together as bird styles, yet they vary wildly. All relatively new styles, they use weapons not typically favored by elves. Eagle-style bladesingers use small handaxes, and many maneuvers in the style focus on fluid ways to throw the weapon and draw a new one. Raven style uses a war pick, and spells associated with it grant the bladesinger more agility in combat.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Snake\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Snake.</span> Practitioners of these styles use a flail, chain, or whip. Viper style uses a whip, despite its inelegance as a weapon, and has almost as long a history as the lion style. Its masters punctuate their bladesong with a stunningly rapid rhythm of whip cracks, which can keep many foes at bay and allow the bladesinger space to cast the cruel spells of poison and disease favored by the style.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Level 6: Extra Attack\" data-source=\"TCE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"14\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything, p76\">Level 6: Extra Attack</span></h3><p>Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the @action[Attack] action on your turn.

mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in @language[Druidic]. The circle's wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle's mysterious rites.</p><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Level 2: Bonus Cantrip\" data-source=\"PHB\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"5\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Player’s Handbook (2014), p68\">Level 2: Bonus Cantrip</span></h3><p>You learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice.

You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p><p>For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots.

Blades perform stunts such as sword swallowing, knife throwing and juggling, and mock combats. Though they use their weapons to entertain, they are also highly trained and skilled warriors in their own right.</p><p>Their talent with weapons inspires many blades to lead double lives. One blade might use a circus troupe as cover for nefarious deeds such as assassination, robbery, and blackmail. Other blades strike at the wicked, bringing justice to bear against the cruel and powerful. Most troupes are happy to accept a blade's talent for the excitement it adds to a performance, but few entertainers fully trust a blade in their ranks.</p><p>Blades who abandon their lives as entertainers have often run into trouble that makes maintaining their secret activities impossible. A blade caught stealing or engaging in vigilante justice is too great a liability for most troupes. With their weapon skills and magic, these blades either take up work as enforcers for thieves' guilds or strike out on their own as adventurers.</p><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Level 3: Bonus Proficiencies\" data-source=\"XGE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"10\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, p15\">Level 3: Bonus Proficiencies</span></h3><p>When you join the College of Swords at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor and the @item[scimitar|phb].</p><p>If you're proficient with a simple or martial melee weapon, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Level 3: Fighting Style\" data-source=\"XGE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"11\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, p15\">Level 3: Fighting Style</span></h3><p>At 3rd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty.

On Ravnica, the domain is favored by clerics of the Azorius Senate, who use it to maintain and enforce the law, and of the Orzhov Syndicate, who exploit law and order for their personal gain. On other worlds, gods who grant access to this domain include @deity[Bane], @deity[Tyr], @deity[Majere|Dragonlance], @deity[Erathis|Dawn War|DMG], @deity[Pholtus|Greyhawk], @deity[Wee Jas|Greyhawk], @deity[Aureon|Eberron], @deity[Maglubiyet|Nonhuman], @deity[Nuada|Celtic], @deity[Athena|Greek], @deity[Anubis|Egyptian], @deity[Forseti|Norse], and @deity[Asmodeus|Dawn War|DMG].</p><p>The ideal of order is obedience to the law above all else, rather than to a specific individual or the passing influence of emotion or popular rule. Clerics of order are typically concerned with how things are done, rather than whether an action's results are just. Following the law and obeying its edicts is critical, especially when it benefits these clerics and their guilds or deities.</p><p>Law establishes hierarchies. Those selected by the law to lead must be obeyed. Those who obey must do so to the best of their ability.

The tradition of War Magic blends principles of evocation and abjuration, rather than specializing in either of those schools. It teaches techniques that empower a caster's spells, while also providing methods for wizards to bolster their own defenses.</p><p>Followers of this tradition are known as war mages. They see their magic as both a weapon and armor, a resource superior to any piece of steel. War mages act fast in battle, using their spells to seize tactical control of a situation. Their spells strike hard, while their defensive skills foil their opponents' attempts to counterattack.

When you focus your ki, you can align yourself with the forces of creation and bend the four elements to your will, using them as an extension of your body. Some members of this tradition dedicate themselves to a single element, but others weave the elements together.</p><p>Many monks of this tradition tattoo their bodies with representations of their ki powers, commonly imagined as coiling dragons, but also as phoenixes, fish, plants, mountains, and cresting waves.</p><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Level 3: Disciple of the Elements\" data-source=\"PHB\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"22\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Player’s Handbook (2014), p80\">Level 3: Disciple of the Elements</span></h3><p>You learn magical disciplines that harness the power of the four elements.

See <a href=\"https://2014.5e.tools/book.html#PHB,10\">chapter 10</a> of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting. To cast one of these spells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you don't need to provide material components for it.</p><p>Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional ki points to increase the level of an elemental discipline spell that you cast, provided that the spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level, as @UUID[Compendium.renegados-compendium.magias.Item.WGdHm2U73KdKbVJ2] does. The spell's level increases by 1 for each additional ki point you spend. For example, if you are a 5th-level monk and use Sweeping Cinder Strike to cast @UUID[Compendium.renegados-compendium.magias.Item.WGdHm2U73KdKbVJ2], you can spend 3 ki points to cast it as a 2nd-level spell (the discipline's base cost of 2 ki points plus 1).</p><p>The maximum number of ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost and any additional ki points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your monk level, as shown in the Spells and Ki Points table. At 5th level, you may spend up to 3 ki points; this increases to 4 ki points at 9th level, 5 at 13th level, and 6 at 17th level.</p><table class=\"w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Spells and Ki Points\"><caption>Spells and Ki Points</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"rd__th ve-col-5 ve-text-center \" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Monk Levels</th><th class=\"rd__th ve-col-7 ve-text-center \" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Maximum Ki Points for a Spell</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-5 ve-text-center \">5th-8th</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-7 ve-text-center \">3</td></tr><tr><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-5 ve-text-center \">9th-12th</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-7 ve-text-center \">4</td></tr><tr><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-5 ve-text-center \">13th-16th</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-7 ve-text-center \">5</td></tr><tr><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-5 ve-text-center \">17th-20th</td><td class=\"rd__th ve-col-7 ve-text-center \">6</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Level 3: Elemental Disciplines\" data-source=\"PHB\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"24\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Player’s Handbook (2014), p80\">Level 3: Elemental Disciplines</span></h3><p>The elemental disciplines are presented in alphabetical order.
