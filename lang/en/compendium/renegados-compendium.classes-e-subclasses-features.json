You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See <a href=\"https://2014.5e.tools/book.html#PHB,4\">chapter 5</a>, \"Equipment,\" in the <a href=\"https://2014.5e.tools/book.html#PHB\">Player's Handbook</a> for descriptions of these tools.</p><p>After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"The Magic of Artifice\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"2\"><h4 class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Magic of Artifice</h4><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"></span></span><p>As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you're using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast @UUID[Compendium.renegados-compendium.magias.Item.OPgAHovN4oGjfcy2] using @item[alchemist's supplies|PHB], you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using @item[tinker's tools|PHB], you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast @UUID[Compendium.renegados-compendium.magias.Item.W2XCjb7Sl4yNfSW4], you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.</p><p>The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don't study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you'll use to produce your effects. If you replace @UUID[Compendium.renegados-compendium.magias.Item.OPgAHovN4oGjfcy2] with @UUID[Compendium.renegados-compendium.magias.Item.A3AuUejmrtqs5H07], you might be altering the device you use to heal—perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy.</p><p>Such details don't limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell's effects. You don't have to justify how you're using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.</p></div></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Cantrips (0-Level Spells)\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"3\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Cantrips (0-Level Spells)</span></h3> <p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the <a href=\"https://2014.5e.tools/spells.html#blankhash,flstlevel:0=1,flstclass:artificer=1\">artificer spell list</a>.

When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form.

Transforming doesn't break your @status[concentration] on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as @UUID[Compendium.renegados-compendium.magias.Item.ryT4r1jmsCDsv7lr], that you've already cast.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so.
